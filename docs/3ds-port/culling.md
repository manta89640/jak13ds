# Not sending geometry that never reaches the screen (AI-assisted, Nov 11)

(AI-assisted.) Ten ways of keeping level triangles that can't show from the GPU, one commit each.
What a title flight frame sent before (performance.md "What the GPU time buys", host soft
renderer): of ~125k level triangles after the LOD work, ~42k behind nearer geometry, ~33k without a
pixel center, many back faces of double-sided draws, ~4% off screen.

Status of all of them: written and checked on the host (unit tests in `test/ctr_render`, the
renderer and converter build), **not yet run in Azahar or on a console**. Every one is behind its
own config.ini key and off by default, so a build without them in config.ini draws as before. The
ones with converter data need the levels converted again.

| # | key | removes | needs |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | `ps2_lod_scale` | detail the 240-line screen can't show (coarse versions nearer) | nothing |

## 6. The PS2's detail distances for a 240-line screen

The PS2 drew 448 lines (Jak 1; Jak II 416), the top screen 240, through the same camera. A shape
difference of `e` at distance `d` covers `e / d x lines / (2 tan(fov / 2))` pixels, so the 3DS shows
at `d x 240 / 448` the error the PS2 showed at `d`. `ps2_lod_scale = auto` multiplies the PS2's
level of detail distances by that ratio (0.54 Jak 1, 0.58 Jak II); a number (0.3-1) sets it.

What it changes (`draw_level`, `ctr_ps2_lod_scale`): the tie groups' PS2 floor (`lod_floor_k`), the
geomorph's mid- and far-planes (`kd`, which `morph_k` hands to the morph rows: the shader's bands
move with the switches), older files' switch distance; the tfrag geomorph's group versions and its
bands (`m_tf_band`, `m_tf_wv`). Not changed: the screen-space error rule (`tie_lod_px`), the
title's 100 m minimum, near chunk reading (still by the PS2's distances: more read than needed),
merc LOD (the game's), shrub and tie distance limits.

Why the picture holds: the switch and the morph move together, so nothing switches unmorphed; the
far versions' own vertex colors (lodnear's "coarse models really close") now show nearer, by the
same factor. That is the thing to look at on a console.

No unit test: it is a factor on existing distances (the host build checks the plumbing).

**To check on a console:** `ps2_lod_scale = auto`; village1, the beach and the title flight: look
at rocks, huts and cliffs as they come nearer (shape and shading changes), compare the triangle
counts and `render ms/frame` with 1.
